    <p>Tiny Rex is a friendly dinosaur! He is just like a normal T-rex except he is miniature sized and lives in what is now known as Boulder, Colorado. He loves to ski, with his mini skis of course, and hike the flatirons, although it takes him many hours to summit because of his tiny legs. Every day he wishes he could grow to full size but just can’t figure out how! He scours Boulder each day in search of a genius to help him develop a grow gun so he can achieve his full potential and fit in with the other dinosaurs of Boulder. One of these days he is sure to find the right scientist who is willing to help out…</p>

    Anna Atomic is a young scientist also living in Boulder, Colorado. She's just a normal scientist on the outside, but on the inside she has BIG dreams. Anna has been working in a nanomaterials lab ever since graduating from CU Boulder, and although it pays well, something feels wrong. The lab she works in is renowned all over the world, because everyone is looking for ways to compact their lives, but Anna feels like a world with objects so small is just meaningless. Every day, she wonders if their is something greater she could be doing with her life.
